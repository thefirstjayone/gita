    "en": "The method I am advising will not waste any of your effort. Using it, you can be free from the fear of any contrary result. Even a little practice of this method will save you from the greatest fear of all, the fear of death.\nThe point I am presenting is very simple. You must continually practise performing action without placing your attention on its results. The mind always acts thinking that the result of action will fulfill some expectation or desire. The practice that I am recommending will train your mind into Nishkaam Karm Yog. This means that your attention, rather than resting on the level of action, will dwell in the inner field of Pure Existence which is held in your head and heart in the state of nishkaam, or desirelessness, thoughtlessness.\nWhen your individual attention is kept on nishkaam karm, desireless action, it will be united with or transformed into the Pure Existence of the unmoved, unwavering state of all action. This state is the emanating source of all the waves and thoughts which, when the mind is built, pertain to action. Arjun, in due course of time and practice, your present level of mental consciousness will be totally transformed into the state of nishkaam karm, in which there is no loss of energy in the performance of action. Then you will have no reason to wonder whether or not your efforts will be wasted.\nIn the Nishkaam Karm Yog state of existence at the source of the mind, there is no hurdle or interruption resulting from mental considerations. Once started, your action will not be interrupted by thoughts of whether or not you will succeed. Arjun, if you practise this type of action even for a short while, you will gain the power of your own true nature, Sat-Chit-Aanand, which will completely remove the fear of death, the source of all the mind’s fears.\nNishkaam Karm Yog is the practice of meditation on your true Self, which is Me. You must practise it without bothering about the result, for when you meditate on your true nature, Me, the Self, you will realize that every thought of gain and loss is only happening on the active level of the mind. This level is simply the manifest aspect of Me, the Self, whose name is Nishkaam Karm Yog. When you have realized that there is only Me, the Self, your true nature, at the base of all thinking in terms of gain and loss, happiness and unhappiness, victory and defeat, then you will have attained the Vision of God. In this Vision all the aspects of manifestation—thought, speech, action, or any happening inside or outside of you—are known to be manifestations of your own Self. In this Vision alone will you be free from all the fears which occur on the level of sakaam karm yog, the sense of duality or thought of ahankaar, in which it is held that you are separate, the world is separate, and the original giver of all action, God, is also separate somewhere.\nSince, as an army general, you are concerned with performing action on the battlefield, you must be sure about the source-power of your thought, speech, and action. It is Me alone, the very Self of your own self, the Self of all manifest beings on earth. In tune with the state of Nishkaam Karm Yog, you will come to grasp on the mind level that this personality of Arjun is not the doer, that the real doer is Me, God, the Self. The individual “me” is merely a tool, a vehicle which the real Being uses for the sake of establishing the Vision of Oneness, the Knowledge that God is everywhere. Arjun, this Vision will remove the vision of duality which has taken over your enemies now arrayed against you.\nBy attaining the Knowledge of Nishkaam Karm Yog, in which you are merely an actor on the stage, you will be able to perform your duty perfectly free from care or fear. Arjun, adopting this attitude, which is My Knowledge, will definitely release your mind now bound in the field of ideas in which you wonder whether or not you should fight. Later on, I will reveal the specific technique of how this practice should be conducted in terms of meditation, its place, and its environment.",
